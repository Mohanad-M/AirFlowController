_Intro:
The Air controller chart is a system that cools a physical plant by transitioning between
several modes of operation and, therefore, can be modeled as a finite state machine.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Analysis of operting modes (states):
__Mode#01 - Power Off
\_Desc.:
    Turns off all power in the control system.
\_Dependencies:
    No fan can operate when power is off.

__Mode#02 - Power On
\_Desc.:
    Turns on all power in the control system.
\_Dependencies:
    Zero, one, or two fans can operate when power is on.

__Mode#03 - Fan 1
\_Desc.:
    Activates Fan 1.
\_Dependencies:
    Fan 1 can be active at the same time as Fan 2. When activated, Fan 1 can turn on or
    off.

__Mode#04 - Fan 1 On
\_Desc.:
    Cycles on Fan 1.
\_Dependencies:
    Fan 1 On can be active if Fan 1 is active and power is on.

__Mode#05 - Fan 1 Off
\_Desc.:
    Cycles off Fan 1.
\_Dependencies:
    Fan 1 Off can be active if Fan 1 is active and power is on.

__Mode#06 - Fan 2
\_Desc.:
    Activates Fan 2
\_Dependencies:
    Fan 2 can be active at the same time as Fan 1. When activated, Fan 2 can turn on or
    off.

__Mode#07 - Fan 2 On
\_Desc.:
    Cycles on Fan 2.
\_Dependencies:
    Fan 2 On can be active if Fan 2 is active and power is on.

__Mode#08 - Fan 2 Off
\_Desc.:
    Cycles of Fan 2.
\_Dependencies:
    Fan 2 Off can be active if Fan 2 is active and power is on.

__Mode#09 - Calculate airflow
\_Desc.:
    Calculates a constant value of 0, 1, or 2 to indicate how fast ir is flowing. Outputs
    this value to simulink subsystem for selecting a cooling factor.
\_Dependencies:
    Calculates the constant value, based on how many fans have cycled on at each time
    step.

_States definition: State Name  ->  Operating Mode
PowerOff    ->  Power Off
PowerOn     ->  Power On
FAN1        ->  Fan 1
FAN2        ->  Fan 2
SpeedValue  ->  Calculate airflow
FAN1.On     -?  Fan 1 On
FAN1.Off    -?  Fan 1 Off
FAN2.On     ->  Fan 2 On
FAN2.Off    ->  Fan 2 Off
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_State Hierarchy:
\_Dependent States:
DS#01 - FAN1 and FAN2 depend on PowerOn. No fan can operate unless PowerOn is active.
DS#02 - FAN1.On and FAN1.Off depend on FAN1 and PowerOn.FAN1 must be active before it can
        be cycled on or off.
DS#03 - FAN2.On and FAN2.Off depend on FAN2 and PowerOn.FAN2 must be active before it can
        be cycled on or off.
DS#04 - The state that calculates airflow needs to know how many fans are running at each
        timestep.
\_Implied Hierarchy:
(ref. DS#01) - FAN1 and FAN2 should be substates of a PowerOn state.
(ref. DS#02) - FAN1 should have two substates. On and Off. In this hierarchical
               relationship, On and Off will inherit from FAN1 the dependency on PowerOn.
(ref. DS#03) - FAN2 should have two substates. On and Off. In this hierarchical
               relationship, On and Off will inherit from FAN2 the dependency on PowerOff.
(ref. DS#04) - The state that calculates airflow should be a substate of PowerOn so it can
               check the status of FAN1 and FAN2 at the same level of hierarchy.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_States Decomposition:
\_PowerOff, PowerOn:
Decomposition - Exclusive (OR) states.
Rationale - The power can never be on and off at the same time.

\_FAN1, FAN2:
Decomposition - Parallel (AND) states.
Rationale - Zero, one, or two fans can operate at the same time, depending on how much
            cooling is required.

\_FAN1.On, FAN1.Off:
Decomposition - Exclusive (OR) states.
Rationale - Fan 1 can never be on and off at the same time.

\_FAN2.On, FAN2.Off:
Decomposition - Exclusive (OR) states.
Rationale - Fan 2 can never be on and off at the same time.

\_SpeedValue:
Decomposition - Parallel (AND) state.
Rationale - SpeedValue is an observer state that monitors the status of Fan 1 and Fan 2,
            updating its output based on how many fans are operating at each time step.
            SpeedValue must be activiated at the same time as Fan 1 and Fan 2, but
            execute last so it can capture the most current status of the fans.
