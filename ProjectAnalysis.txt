__Action Analysis:

\_Action - Initialize airflow to 0
_|When: before simulation.
_|How: Setting an initial value when first defining airflow.

\_Action - Set airflow to 0
_|When: Whenever power is off.
_|How: Add an action in the state PowerOff.

\_Action - Update airflow to 0, 1, or 2 based on how many fans are running.
_|When: Whenever power is on.
_|How: Add an action in the state SpeedValue, which becomes active concurrently with FAN1
       and FAN2 when the state PowerOn is active.

__Actions based on the analysis:
A1. Entry action in state PowerOff to set airflow to 0.
A2. During action in state SpeedValue to calculate the value of airflow at every time
    step.

__Actions Syntax:

(ref. A1) - entry: airflow = 0;
\_initialize airflow to 0 once entering the PowerOff state.
(ref. A2) - during: in(FAN1.On) + in(FAN2.Off);
\_update the value of airflow during the execution of SpeedValue state. The boolean
expression in(FAN1.On) is true -- and its value equals 1 -- if the On state of FAN1 is
active. If FAN1 is not on -- that is, its Off state is active or power is off -- then
in(FAN1.On) equals 0. Similarly, the value of in(FAN2.On) represents whether FAN2 is on or
off. Therefore, the sum of these boolean expressions indicates whether 0, 1, or 2 fans are
operating during each time step.

__State Transitions:

The Air Controller chart models a system in which power can cycle on and off and, while
power is on, fans can cycle on and off. Six exclusive (OR) states represents these
operating modes. To model this activity, the following transitions between exclusive (OR)
states were added:
\_ PowerOff ->  PowerOn
\_ PowerOn	->  PowerOff
\_ FAN1.Off ->  FAN1.On
\_ FAN1.On  ->  FAN1.Off
\_ FAN2.Off ->  FAN2.On
\_ FAN2.On  ->  FAN2.Off
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
__Default Transitions:

There are three areas of ambiguity in the Air Controller chart:
\_ When the chart wakes up, should power be on or off?
\_ When FAN1 becomes active, should it be on or off?
\_ When FAN2 becomes active, should it be on or off?

__|In each case the initial state should be off.

__Transition Guarding:

\_Transition - PowerOff->PowerOn, PowerOn->PowerOff
_|Occurance: At regular time intervals.
_|Guard: Edge-triggered event.

\_Transition - FAN1.Off->FAN1.On
_|Occurance: when the temperature of the physical plant rises above 120 degrees.
_|Guard: condition based on temperature value.

\_Transition - FAN1.On->FAN1.Off
_|Occurance: when the temperature of the physical plant falls below 120 degrees.
_|Guard: condition based on temperature value.

\_Transition - FAN2.Off->FAN2.On
_|Occurance: when the temperature rises above 150 degrees, a threshold indicating that
             first fan is not providing the required amount of cooling.
_|Guard: condition based on temperature value.

\_Transition - FAN2.On->FAN2.Off
_|Occurance: when the temperature falls below 150 degrees.
_|Guard: condition based on temperature value.
