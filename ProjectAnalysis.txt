__Action Analysis:
\_Action - Initialize airflow to 0
When: before simulation.
How: Setting an initial value when first defining airflow.

\_Action - Set airflow to 0
When: Whenever power is off.
How: Add an action in the state PowerOff.

\_Action - Update airflow to 0, 1, or 2 based on how many fans are running.
When: Whenever power is on.
How: Add an action in the state SpeedValue, which becomes active concurrently with FAN1
     and FAN2 when the state PowerOn is active.

__Actions based on the analysis:
1. Entry action in state PowerOff to set airflow to 0.
2. During action in state SpeedValue to calculate the value of airflow at every time step.
