The following sections describe the rationale for the inputs and outputs of the Stateflow
chart:

_Inputs from the Simulink model:
\_Type:         temperature of the physical plant.

\_Rationale:    the purpose of the chart is to control the air temperature in a
physical plant. The goal is to maintain an ideal temperature of 120 degrees by activating
one or two cooling fans if necessary. The chart must check the plant temperature over time
to determine the amount of cooling required.

\_Properties:
Name: temp _ Scope: Input _ Size: Inherit from Simulink input signal for compatability _
Data type: Inhert from Simulink input signal for compatability _ Port: 1


_Outputs required from Stateflow chart:
\_Type:         Speed of airflow, based on how many fans are operating.
\_Rationale:    When the simulink subsystem determines the temperature of the physical
plant over time, it needs to account for the speed of the airflow. Airflow speed is
directly related to the amount of cooling activity generated by the fans. As more fans are
activated, cooling activity increases and air flows faster. To convey this information,
the Stateflow chart outputs a value that indicates whether 0, 1, or 2 fans are running.
The simulink subsystem uses this value as an index into a multiport switch, which outputs
a cooling activity value.

be only 0, 1, or 2.) _ Port: 1
